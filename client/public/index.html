            <h3>Why I made Interview<span>Mentor.</span></h3>
            <p>I made Interview<span>Mentor</span> while preparing for my co-op intake interview because I wanted to help people prepare for any sort of interview.

        This is why Interview<span>Mentor</span> mimics a real interview by adding a "virtual" human asking you questions. Feedback is given in real time after each question tailored toward each unique question.
        <br><br>I also know that you have specific questions you may want to test yourself on which is why Interview<span>Mentor</span> allows you to input any question you would like. By providing a powerful 
        tool to practice and refine interview skills, I hope to help more people land their dream jobs.</p>
