# Interview Mentor

Interview Mentor is a basic project that serves as a platform for practicing interview skills. It is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Node.js and Express for the back-end.

## Deployment

The front-end of the project is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a platform ideal for static and Jamstack deployments. The back-end, on the other hand, is deployed using [Render](https://render.com/), a unified platform to build and run all your apps and websites with free SSL, a global CDN, private networks and auto deploys from Git.

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been a significant learning journey. It has provided hands-on experience with front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project has also provided exposure to working with APIs. Initially, it used the OPENAI API, but it has since been updated to use Google Gemini, as it provides a free tier.

The back-end server work using Node.js and Express has also been a valuable learning experience, providing insights into server-side programming and the integration of APIs into a project.

## Future Improvements

There are several areas of improvement identified for future iterations of the project. These include better flow, user experience changes, ability to add as many questions as you like,
having questions tailored to a specific industry and much more! This was one of the very first projects I completed so I can find many things to improve.
