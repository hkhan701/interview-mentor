# interview-mentor

Front-end was deployed using Vercel,
Back-end was deployed using Render (Node.js and Express)

This project taught me a lot about front end development using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. Looking back I definitely see areas of improvement
and ways I can optimize my styling without the need to repeat code. 

I learned about APIs, specifically from OPENAI and how to integrate it into my project, along with a little bit of backend server work
using Node.js and Express.
